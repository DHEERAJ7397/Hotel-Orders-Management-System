The above is the highligts and the key which are followed in this project.

It is an application designed for hotels to eliminate the risks and taks on hotel servers. Also maintaining smooth flow of tasks and priority of orders. 

This applition has 2 parties i.e, customers and Hoteliers. Hoteliers again split into admin and staffs. There can be many staffs and many customers but it can have only one admin as defined in DB. 

As the customers hotels the hotel, she need to signin to authenticate herself. Followed by which she needs to scan the QR code kept on the table or anywhere in the hotel and next to enter the table number where she occupies the space. Once the Customer scans QR, the list of menu is displayed on her screen. she can choose any item and order and also she can pay too through any online modes. The Admin needs to first signup by providing his hotel details and should register all of his staffs. The admin can list all available menus in his hotel and should generate qr code. Here QR code generated is dynamic as it is mapped to menu database directly (Code First Approach). Once the customer places order staffs on a queue basis get the orders on thier mobile screen by which they can deliver the orders. 

Thus Business requirements are too high, approaching these type of solutions has become a need nowadays.
